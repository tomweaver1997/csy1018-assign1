Assignment 1: CV Website

# Starting Point
Before I started the design stage of my personal CV website, I felt I needed to first do some research into some real CV website of individuals in the field of work to get an idea of the kind of styles and ways that they presented themselves through their sites. Some cgood examples of well-crafted profile websites include;

# Designs
## Intial Sketchs
Before I went about creating the wireframes for what each of my pages on the website would look like, I thought it would be appropriate to first get a idea of what the shape of the pages would look like and where everything would go.

The first design that created was logically the home page. This would be the main hub of the website as it would be the first thing that the viewer would see when they accessed the site. In terms of the design of the website, I wanted the overall style to be something simple, as to not fill up the page and would be easy to use for the user. I intended to use a navigation bar located at the top of the page with a logo which I would create latter located in the same section of the page. When you accessed the site, small greeting message would appear alongside an image of myself to welcome the user onto the site with the other pages also having links below help them navigate to the page of their choosing.

The next page of the website was the bio page, which would contain information about myself. I would use the left-hand side of the page to input the information that wasn’t related to my CV. As I wanted to add several images to this page but wanted to keep it from getting to cluttered, I had the idea of a collection in the right-hand side of the page where it would change as several seconds to the next. I am also going to introduce a fun facts section at the bottom of the page help the viewer to get to know me better.

The third page of the website and perhaps the most important is the CV page itself. On the left side of the screen I intent to provide information related to my actual skills and education while the right-hand side would be more focused on details of what I do and examples of work to back up my portfolio.


![Contact] (https://i.gyazo.com/a6c94ece5bacdc138ce057b6c93e58f7.png)

The final part of the website that needed to be created was the contact page, as this would provide the user with information required to contact me through either my social media accounts or through my email. The email box is intended to a form for the user to fill out on the page. 

![Contact Form] (https://i.gyazo.com/10907a3245abd1152492ee9edca3ac9e.png)

The contact form design was created with the intention of making it simple to fill out. It will be located on the contact page rather then being its own page and boxed to so that all the information required is focused in one area of the page.

## Logo Design
On my website, I wanted to create my own logo with could also be used a home button function for navigation as well.
For the logo design itself, I wanted to somehow combine both starting letters of both my first name and my last name together to form one image. Before I had picked a final design for what the logo should look like, I went about searching online for some inspiration for what type of style was both appropriate for the site as well as one that I liked and could create in a similar style.
Eventually I found one logo which I liked the style which belonged to pro golfer Tiger Woods. The thing that I liked about the style of this image was the way that T fitted together with the W to form one unique image on its own.

Drawing inspiration from this, I then went and designed my own logo using the same kind of style as the image above. I made several designs to what the logo could possibly look like and in the end, I selected the idea of the third design, as the first was too similar to that of Tiger Wood’s logo and I simply preferred the idea of the design over that of the second one

The first design was different then my inspiration in the way that I made the whole image into almost circular in shape, with every part of the design connected to each other, creating a unique design that incorporated parts from both designs 
I ended up with two designs:

Design 1

## Navagation bar 
For the navagation throughout the site, i created two diagrams. The first was created to provide myself a references to the movement through the site, showing that every page was linked.

The second diagram that i created was the same as the first but included the links outside of the site. On the CV page, i included a link to my github account to proivde viewer a way to access my previous pieces of work as well as my new projects. The other links for in the Conact page, which would take the viewer to my various social media accounts to provide a way for them to contact me as well as the option to email about their enquries.
