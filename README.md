Assignment 1: CV Website

# Starting Point
Before I started the design stage of my personal CV website, I felt I needed to first do some research into some real CV website of individuals in the field of work to get an idea of the kind of styles and ways that they presented themselves through their sites. Some cgood examples of well-crafted profile websites include;

# Designs
## Intial Sketchs
Before I went about creating the wireframes for what each of my pages on the website would look like, I thought it would be appropriate to first get a idea of what the shape of the pages would look like and where everything would go.

The first design that created was logically the home page. This would be the main hub of the website as it would be the first thing that the viewer would see when they accessed the site. In terms of the design of the website, I wanted the overall style to be something simple, as to not fill up the page and would be easy to use for the user. I intended to use a navigation bar located at the top of the page with a logo which I would create latter located in the same section of the page. When you accessed the site, small greeting message would appear alongside an image of myself to welcome the user onto the site with the other pages also having links below help them navigate to the page of their choosing.

The next page of the website was the bio page, which would contain information about myself. I would use the left-hand side of the page to input the information that wasnâ€™t related to my CV. As I wanted to add several images to this page but wanted to keep it from getting to cluttered, I had the idea of a collection in the right-hand side of the page where it would change as several seconds to the next. I am also going to introduce a fun facts section at the bottom of the page help the viewer to get to know me better.

The third page of the website and perhaps the most important is the CV page itself. On the left side of the screen I intent to provide information related to my actual skills and education while the right-hand side would be more focused on details of what I do and examples of work to back up my portfolio.


![Contact] https://i.gyazo.com/a6c94ece5bacdc138ce057b6c93e58f7.png

The final part of the website that needed to be created was the contact page, as this would provide the user with information required to contact me through either my social media accounts or through my email. The email box is intended to a form for the user to fill out on the page. 

![Contact Form] https://i.gyazo.com/10907a3245abd1152492ee9edca3ac9e.png

The contact form design was created with the intention of making it simple to fill out. It will be located on the contact page rather then being its own page and boxed to so that all the information required is focused in one area of the page.
