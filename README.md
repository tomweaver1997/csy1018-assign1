Assignment 1: CV Website

##Timeframe
If I was to estimate how long it took me to complete the website, I would that I spent roughly 50+ hours working on the site. The reason to why can’t give an exact estimate is due to the fact that there were times during the build when I would spend a large amount of time working on section in compression to others. This also includes my various research that went into features around the site as well as the times in which I have gone back to previous completed section and made alterations.

##
During this assignment, I have discussed the assignment with my flat mate Aaron Gibbins and with my course mate Ben McKeown. These discussions have been related to what the what we thought the assignment was asking us to do in our individual website as well as highlighting to one another about the 

# Starting Point
Before I started the design stage of my personal CV website, I felt I needed to first do some research into some real CV website of individuals in the field of work to get an idea of the kind of styles and ways that they presented themselves through their sites. Some good examples of well-crafted profile websites include;

# Designs
## Initial Sketch’s
Before I went about creating the wireframes for what each of my pages on the website would look like, I thought it would be appropriate to first get an idea of what the shape of the pages would look like and where everything would go.

![Home] (https://i.gyazo.com/8e8222496db2c6b444efa7d6d13f38c4.png )

The first design that created was logically the home page. This would be the main hub of the website as it would be the first thing that the viewer would see when they accessed the site. In terms of the design of the website, I wanted the overall style to be something simple, as to not fill up the page and would be easy to use for the user. I intended to use a navigation bar located at the top of the page with a logo which I would create latter located in the same section of the page. When you accessed the site, small greeting message would appear alongside an image of myself to welcome the user onto the site with the other pages also having links below help them navigate to the page of their choosing. 

![Bio] (https://i.gyazo.com/d812b7e9acfd4c61e7d7f2d6467ae7df.png )

The next page of the website was the bio page, which would contain information about myself. I would use the left-hand side of the page to input the information that wasn’t related to my CV. As I wanted to add several images to this page but wanted to keep it from getting to cluttered, I had the idea of a collection in the right-hand side of the page where it would change as several seconds to the next. I am also going to introduce a fun facts section at the bottom of the page help the viewer to get to know me better.


![CV] (https://i.gyazo.com/bb0583966d6b816e34fe849820bbc8d7.png )

The third page of the website and perhaps the most important is the CV page itself. On the left side of the screen I intent to provide information related to my actual skills and education while the right-hand side would be more focused on details of what I do and examples of work to back up my portfolio.


![Contact] (https://i.gyazo.com/a6c94ece5bacdc138ce057b6c93e58f7.png )

The final part of the website that needed to be created was the contact page, as this would provide the user with information required to contact me through either my social media accounts or through my email. The email box is intended to a form for the user to fill out on the page. 

![Contact Form] (https://i.gyazo.com/10907a3245abd1152492ee9edca3ac9e.png )

The contact form design was created with the intention of making it simple to fill out. It will be located on the contact page rather than being its own page and boxed to so that all the information required is focused in one area of the page.

##Redesign
Shortly after I started the build stage of my assignment, I was forced to redesign the webpages due to a problem with getting the various divs to align to the positions that I had originally planned to place them. Because of this, I altered the designs so that no the page would be a list of all of my different images and information boxes.

! [New Contact sketch] (https://i.gyazo.com/3436852fe957f9ff31e27d8f36f76f39.png)

I also removed my original idea of image slider for the image slideshow on the Bio page as it required java which was against the design brief. After attempting to try and use several different solutions to this through various sites, I decided to swap the slideshow for a list of images down the page to follow with the rest of website.

## Logo Design
On my website, I wanted to create my own logo with could also be used a home button function for navigation as well.
For the logo design, itself, I wanted to somehow combine both starting letters of both my first name and my last name together to form one image. Before I had picked a final design for what the logo should look like, I went about searching online for some inspiration for what type of style was both appropriate for the site as well as one that I liked and could create in a similar style.
Eventually I found one logo which I liked the style which belonged to pro golfer Tiger Woods. The thing that I liked about the style of this image was the way that T fitted together with the W to form one unique image on its own.

! [TigerWoods Design] (https://i.gyazo.com/1dd77bc9cbfdc06b3f0a83f9690834b3.png)

Drawing inspiration from this, I then went and designed my own logo using the same kind of style as the image above. I made several designs to what the logo could possibly look like and in the end, I selected the idea of the third design, as the first was too similar to that of Tiger Wood’s logo and I simply preferred the idea of the design over that of the second one 

! [Design drawings] (https://i.gyazo.com/e551d6368e605f1ec3974d86cf0e3d5b.png)

The first design was different then my inspiration in the way that I made the whole image into almost circular in shape, with every part of the design connected to each other, creating a unique design that incorporated parts from both designs 
I ended up with two designs:

Design 1

! [Logo Design 1] (https://i.gyazo.com/b9349a9390feaba958a9747e00ed544e.png) 

Design 2 

! [Logo Design 2] (https://i.gyazo.com/0286c692b189a643cf31e73bd12503e2.png)


After some thought, I decided on the second design, even though it moved away original sketch, I felt it was better designed and was more suitable for my website as it shaped better then design 1. 

## Navigation bar 
For the navigation throughout the site, I created two diagrams. The first was created to provide myself a reference to the movement through the site, showing that every page was linked. 

! [NavBar Flowchart] (https://i.gyazo.com/905c192a540b7d127bd7ad20318e3cab.png)

The second diagram that I created was the same as the first but included the links outside of the site. On the CV page, I included a link to my github account to provide viewer a way to access my previous pieces of work as well as my new projects. The other links for in the Contact page, which would take the viewer to my various social media accounts to provide a way for them to contact me as well as the option to email with their enquires.

#Work Log
##November 27 2016
This is the first entry of my work log and signifies the start of my work on the assignment. At this moment in time, all I have done is set up the repository where I will keep my files will be stored.

##November 28th 2016
After doing some research and viewing several personal portfolio websites, I have begun work on the designs of my website. The first thing that I did was start sketching out the layouts for each of the pages that would be created to get a visual idea of what I thought the site could look like.

##November 29th 2016
After completing the initial design sketch’s, I now took the design layouts and converted them into wireframes. After creating the wireframes, I also worked on the flowcharts for navigation around my web page as well as the external pages that would be linked to the site.

## December 2nd 2016
After doing this I know shifted my focus on creating a logo for my website. After doing some research and playing around with different styles I ended up with a final design for my website. Now that I had all the pieces in place to start to make website I started to build the site. However, for some unknown reason, browsersync failed to work with my Macbook. After several attempts to try to fix the problem, I decided I would start the site and try to link it again latter.

## December 3rd 2016
After discovering a detailed tutorial on w3schools, which showcased a variety of ways to create nav bars with multiple features like fixing it to the top, I began work on my pages, creating the navigation bar that would be used the around the website.

## December 4th
Added some addition features to the navbars including the logo for the site as well as making the current page being highlighted as well as implementing a hover when over the other links.

## December 6th
With my navbar finished, I began work on the Home page. I added the welcome image, using flex to align the image to the right side of the page. I also added the welcome message and link button located on the page.
With the page layout now in shape, I played around with the colour scheme for my site, I have decided to use three colours, White and Black as they natural colours for the main contents of the website as I wanted to avoid using bright colours over my pages. The third colour would be the red that I used in my logo. As red is quiet a strong colour

##December 8th 2016
I noticed that my welcome image was out of place, as the image would go through the nevbar and the top of the image was cut off. To fix this, I made use of flexbox to adjust the position of the image so that it would be in the right centre of the page. The next problem was trying to get the text to appear to the right of the image as the text box was above it instead. After spending a period time trying to get the two to aline,
I finally managed to get them to line up next to each but that created another problem. My welcome image now caught behind the header.

! [New Logo position] (https://i.gyazo.com/448967501d6c40c23dd88c219c2f9760.png)

After spending a period time trying to get the two to aline, I finally managed to get them to line up next to each but that created another problem. My welcome image was now caught behind the header.
After reviewing my initial designs, I have decided to alter them. Rather than trying to fill everything on one page, have the different information in block that would came up as you scrolled down the page.
I also moved the logo from the top of the page and into the footer, as the size of the image was affecting the active feature on the header to show the user which page they were on. I did this I didn’t have any think that I had planned to put in the footer plus I would be able to use a bigger size. I feel the image also works as it looks like a watermark for the page itself, which is why I left the footer white while on the other side would be my signature.

! [Home 1] (https://i.gyazo.com/dfea056c5ce01c8ff0e91f095f0d835a.png)
The first image shows the problem i had, as the text would always stay above the image.
Eventually after introducing divs into both objects with flexbox and float functions,
i was able to align the text and image next to one another but this created a new problem.

! [Home 2] (https://i.gyazo.com/dfea056c5ce01c8ff0e91f095f0d835a.png)

In the second image, the picture would get stuck behind the header and cut of the top section of the image.
After several attempts to move the image using flexbox and float, it became apparent that i was wasting too much time,
as i hadn't even introduced the buttons i was going to have on home page below the text.
Rather then continue this style throughout the website, i decided to make some alterations to the layout,
with the all of the objects on the site move downwards rather then sideways as i was more familiar with
using flex in this direction for divs.

##December 10th 2016
I have finished altering my designs and now have changed the layout of the page so that each piece of information is followed by the next rather than being spread around the page due to problems using flexbox to try and make all the divs fit together and sit side by side,
as after several hours of trying, it yielded little success. The welcome text box was now located at the top middle of screen with the image fitting comfortable below it

I also added shadow effects to the both images.

##December 11th 2016
Changed the sizing of the text box on the main page so that now is much more compact.
I have also now added a background image to the site. I took the image from Unsplash, which is a site where you can access and download copyright free images to use.
I juggled with several different backgrounds. These varied from the cathedral in my hone city of Lincoln, to a personal image of my own of my house back in lincolnshire. In the end, keeping with the topic of my profession, I selected a stylistic image of office mac computer

! [Home Page with Background Image] (https://i.gyazo.com/acfb58e6f7044db5579a31e5e42018a4.png)
I thought this image would well for my site as it as there is not a lot of brightness in the image and it wouldn’t clash with the colour scheme which I have in place on the site’s menus and boxes.

##December 13th 2016
Started the Bio Page, inputting the three text boxes through html.
I now began work on my bio page, I created three boxes on the page, each with relevant information relating to the boxes class. I inputted the material that would go into each section and formatted them so that they were spaced out vertically on the page using flexbox. I left the final part of the page for later, the image collection

I attempted to sync the site that I was making with atom to GitHub again now that my index.html page was near completion. However, once again for some reason, browsersync failed to work again.  I uploaded the current version of the site onto GitHub by using the download feature to test if it would work instead as an alternative solution to my problem.

##December 18th 2016
The final part of my bio page is a collection of images of myself. I went about researching ways to create a slideshow using only html and css but had little success with the advice that I found as many of the sliders used jQuery which I cannot use during this assignment. As a result of this I will have to change my design again, this time opting for an image gallery instead as it would allowed greater control of the images due some being different widths and heights.
After playing around with the css, I managed to format my images so that they fit to reasonable standard into the image box which stored them.
On thier own, some of the images would have been two big to fit, so i adjusted several of their size ratio as well as playing around with the margin and width height in the css to make the image fit into the containers
! [Bio Image Example] (https://i.gyazo.com/6b3c9b7e86101f6ecf49eee18955dd04.png)

While I would have preferred to have used a slideshow, I realised using a responsive image gallery was the better choice to use in the end.
with this done, my bio page was now complete.

##December 20th 2016
Work begins on the CV page.
Rather than fix the whole screen with one box and list all the information, I thought that I would be more creative for to have little info boxes as you scrolled down the screen. These are designed to the same look at the text box used on the home page.
For the CV page, split the different question and responses into sections and gave each of them their own boxes.
I realised that the developing skills box for some reason now had another image behind it. Despite my efforts , no matter what I did the box would remain.

##December 21st 2016
The final part of the CV page that needed to be filled in was the 'relevant coursework' section.
Rather then have example of the page, i instead created a link to my GitHub page.
At the bottom of the page I placed a link to my GitHub account for viewers to be able to traverse over to my account and see what projects I have completed as well as which ones I’m currently working on.
To get the icon, I downloaded it of github’s own downloader and checked to make sure I was able to use it before implementing into the design.
I thought it was a smart idea to include this link into my CV as evidence of work, as in the long run i wouldn't have to update the site every time i finished a new piece of work.

##December 28th 2016
With all the other sections of my site completed, i moved onto my final page, the contact page. On the page i planned to have my three social media accounts linked to the page using icons.
i would also created a form at the bottom of the page for the option of emailing me.

##December 29th 2016
Awesome font for social media images
I have downloaded the font awesome css file for the icons of my contact me page. After watching a video explaining how font awesome actually worked to add new images, I used the social media logo for Facebook, twitter and Instagram which would be lined straight to their sites. I also downloaded an email image to use as the header for the form in the contact me section.

##January 4th 2017
Began work on the form that would be used on the contact page. The form itself is based off the one shown during class by Tom Rose which served as the inspiration for my form which contained minor alterations and a different layout

##January 6th 2017
Finished work on the Contact page now that the form has been fully implemented into the page. Checked to make sure that all the links worked, which didn’t in the case of Instagram because I had placed the href for twitter in its line by mistake.

##January 7th 2017
Optimized and made some changes to the images that were ring used on the site. Altered some of their sizes o better fit their positions on the site and then optimized them to decrease their storage space to help with load times.
To do this i made use of the website, http://optimizilla.com/, which was free to use

! [Optimized Images] (https://i.gyazo.com/7be3e5a6d1be1e7a8ed1cd8a6d806606.png)

##January 9th 2017
Added media queries onto all of the pages for a iPhone 6 so that now the page could be ran on my phone.

##January 11th 2017
Realising that I could contain the header and footer, which is the same on all the pages, on just one css sheet rather than in everything one as they had been before now. All I had to do was add the link into the top of each of the pages. This saved up a lot of space and repetitive code.

##January 12th 2017
After asking one of my course mate to look at the front end of the website for feedback on the design of my webpage. While he liked the style of the page and colour scheme, he recommended that perhaps change the text style to a something a bit more professional.
Taking this on board, I changed the selected googlefont, Orbitron, to PT Mono, which gave me the style I was looking for and improved the look of the site.

##January 13th 2017
Today i completed the testing of both my html and my css.

Html testing
All of my html validation was completed using the website: https://validator.w3.org.
I ran each web page separately through the site and was meet with a lot of the same feedback.
I had forgot to close tags, with the bio page containing the most as a result of several mistakes i made when inputting the image files

CSS testing
After I had completed the html validation and corrected the mistakes that were highlighted, I then used the site again to validate my css files as well.

The major error that occurred came from the h1 and h2 at the top of the stylesheets.
What i had done was combined the two by mistake and hadn't noticed until now, meaning that i had to go back and fix it on every style sheet i created.
Another problem came with my over of object alignment statements like margin, as i was often contradicting other statements i had in place.
I also acknowledged that several of my errors came from missing letters out of phrases which had gone unnoticed by myself

##January 15th 2017
I made some more changes from the feedback from the testing.
Uploaded the current site version to GitHub and submitted the repo for assessment.
