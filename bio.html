        <!--Background Infromation -->
        <a>
   My name is Thomas Weaver and i'm a software and web developer.
At this moment in time, I am currently a student at the University of Northampton, where I am studying various aspect of Computing, including Web Development and Software Engineering.
I’ve always had a passion for computing ever since I was a kid and enjoy taking finding a problem and then trying to make something that would be a solution to that problem. This is one of
the major reasons why I love developing all kinds of websites and systems so much, because no project is the same, offering a new challenge everytime.
I would say that I am a hard worker and always determined contribute what I can to the best of my abilities. I’m always on the lookout for new and exciting projects which can test my skills and the experience of that come with these.
At the moment in time, I have a basic understanding of several programming languages including html, css, java and several others as well as a understanding of binary coding.
